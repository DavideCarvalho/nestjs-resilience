/**
 * Pluggable storage interface for circuit-breaker state.
 *
 * **Atomicity contract (MUST be honoured by all implementations):**
 * Both `admit` and `record` must execute as atomic operations — no lost updates,
 * no double-counted failures, and exactly one half-open probe granted under concurrent calls.
 * The built-in `InMemoryResilienceStore` satisfies this for free via JavaScript's
 * single-threaded run-to-completion model. Distributed adapters (Redis, database-backed,
 * etc.) MUST enforce atomicity explicitly — for example via Lua scripts, WATCH/MULTI/EXEC
 * transactions, or compare-and-swap (CAS) primitives — to avoid race conditions that would
 * cause incorrect circuit state.
